# Passionate About Quality & Automation

They say, *"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"* but I believe, **"If it ain't tested, consider it broken."** With **8+ years** in **QA Automation**, I build reliable automation frameworks, fine-tune testing strategies, and lead teams to deliver robust software—quickly and confidently.

## What I Bring:

- **Test Automation:** Python, Java, Selenium, Appium, Robot Framework, REST Assured, Cucumber, JUnit, TestNG
- **CI/CD & Efficiency:** Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Sauce Labs—boosting scalability & reliability
- **Intelligent Testing:** AI-powered automation, defect prediction, Applitools
- **Accessibility Testing:** Axe, AMP, Continuum
- **API & Security:** REST, GraphQL, Postman, Burp Suite
- **Industry Experience:** FinTech, Insurance, Healthcare/Retail
- **Leadership:** Building high-performing teams, promoting best practices, enhancing CI/CD pipelines, and driving cross-team collaboration

I thrive in Agile teams where quality and innovation go hand-in-hand, turning testing into a competitive advantage.
