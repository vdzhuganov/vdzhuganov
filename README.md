# Breaking Bugs & Building Efficiency

They say, *“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”*—but I prefer, *“If it ain’t tested, it’s already broken.”*  

With **8+ years in QA automation**, I don’t just write test scripts—I build **scalable automation frameworks, optimize testing strategies, and lead teams** to deliver flawless software (or at least make sure the bugs are really good at hiding).

## What I Bring to the Table (Besides Coffee & Debugging Jokes):

- **Test Automation:** Python, Java, JUnit, TestNG, Robot Framework, Selenium, Appium, REST Assured, Cucumber, Behave, Katalon Studio  
- **Scaling Quality Like a Pro:** CI/CD with Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Sauce Labs; optimizing test strategies for reliability, efficiency, and scalability  
- **AI & Intelligent Testing:** AI-powered test automation and defect prediction; visual testing with Applitools  
- **Visual & Accessibility Testing:** Axe, AMP, Continuum  
- **API & Security Testing:** REST, GraphQL, Postman; exposure to Burp Suite  
- **Industry Experience:** FinTech & Payments (*Stripe*), Insurance (*State Farm*), Healthcare & Retail (*Rite Aid*)  
- **Leadership & Impact:** Led offshore teams, boosted automation coverage by **25%**, tackled flaky tests head-on, and optimized test planning/reporting  

I thrive in **collaborative Agile environments** where quality, speed, and innovation drive the development of **reliable, high-performing software**.  

By crafting **test strategies** that enhance scalability, improve deployment efficiency, and reduce defects, I help businesses **ship faster with confidence**—turning QA into a **competitive advantage** instead of a bottleneck.

**Always eager to connect** with like-minded professionals and innovative teams scaling their test automation. Let’s chat and **redefine what "done" really means** in software development!
